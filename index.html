        <h1><kbd>What is Discipleship and How is Mary considered to be the first Disciple?</kbd></h1>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info" >What is Discipleship?</h2>
        <h3>Discipleship is when you choose to follow God and all of his actions. When we are baptised, we choose to live in the Family of God. We have promised to be like God and to be in his image. Therefore, we are all considered disciples of God, and it is our responsibility to follow his mission.
        </h3>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info" >How is Mary considered to be the first Disciple?</h2>
        <h3>Mary was the first one to believe and follow Jesus. She accompanied Jesus from His conception in her womb until His death on the cross. Also, at the wedding of Cana when they ran out of wine, Mary pushed Jesus to perform a miracle because she had faith in him. Additionally, In John 19:26 it clearly represents that Mary was the first disciple as he didn’t have any other disciples at the time.

        <h1><kbd>How is Mary a Model for My Grandmother?</kbd></h1>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info" >
            I think that my Grandmother is the perfect example for this question. She always prays to God every day to reconcile her sins and to praise God. It is most likely that God is present in her Life. She has faith and courage to follow the mission of God. She constantly does good deeds whether it is donating or paying respect. She always accepts and listens to others in need. What I like about her is that she always stays humble. I think that Mary is also a model for other women who perform the same things that my Grandmother does.
